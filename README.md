### Ben Buchanan 👨‍💻

A self-taught programmer with a passion for technology and software development. I'm currently enrolled in QA ltd's software development bootcamp, where we're acquiring in-depth knowledge of software design, testing frameworks, full-stack programming, and databases. When I'm not coding, I enjoy staying active in the gym 🏋️‍♂️, gaming 🕹️, and spending time with loved ones 👨‍👩‍👧‍👦.
